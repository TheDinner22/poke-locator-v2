# Poke Lokator V2

used on pokecentral.org to ping someone when a ledgendary spawns

## dependencies

This project uses:

- pyautogui - for screenshots
- pytesseract - image to text
- opencv-python - image manipulation
- pynput - detect mouse input
- playsound - for alerting the user

But you can just run the setup.py file to install all packages  
NOTE: The setup.py file will uninstall all of your pip packages before installing the  
requirements.txt file so be wary of that.  
NOTE2: It will save your previous pip list in a file called "unin.txt" so if  
you want your packages back you can pip install that txt file.
